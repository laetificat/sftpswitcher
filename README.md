VSCode SFTP extension helper.

Extension in question: [SFTP by liximomo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liximomo.sftp)

This tool will make switching servers in a single repository a lot easier.  

Say you have a single project tile forest-app that is used by multiple projects  (valk, fast & fluid, etc), and  
you need to upload to the correct server for each project you need to change the SFTP config for the extension  
every time.  

There is currently no way to save multiple configs, so you'll have to save the JSON configs somewhere and  
copy-paste them into the main sftp.json config each time, this tool does that for you.
